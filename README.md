# MiniConsole
A DIY Arduino-based mini game console that includes simple games, a trivia mode, LED feedback, and lightweight score tracking. The project is modular to make it easy to add new games, LED effects, and hardware tweaks. Models are provided to 3D print the enclosure.

> **TIP:** Use this repository to learn Arduino, extend with your own games, and tweak LED effects.

---

## Features
- Multiple games orchestration and shared helpers in `gamesFunctions.*`
- Trivia mode with questions loaded from `data/questions.tr`
- LED control and animations in `ledFunctions.*`
- Centralized configuration in `config.*`
- Common utilities in `utils.*`
- Score files in `data/` and 3D printable models in `models/`

## Setup
1. Open `MiniConsole.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
2. Select the appropriate board and port.
3. Build and upload the firmware to the board.

---

## Usage
- On boot, the console initializes configuration and LEDs.
- Use the physical controls to select a game or the trivia mode.
- Scores are updated and stored in the corresponding `data/` files.

---

## Configuration
- Adjust pins, timing, brightness, and game options in `config.h` and `config.cpp`.
- Add or edit questions in `data/questions.tr` according to the format used by `trivial.*`.
- Reset or edit scores in `data/leaderboard.tr` and `data/leaderboard.sn` as needed.

---

## Data Formats
- Questions and scores are kept in plain text files under `data/`.
- Inspect `trivial.*` files and game code to define exact formats, then update this section.

---

## Models
| Model File               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MiniConsole.stl`        | Standard 3D model for the MiniConsole enclosure                            |
| `Flat MiniConsole.stl`   | Alternative flat design for the MiniConsole enclosure                      |
